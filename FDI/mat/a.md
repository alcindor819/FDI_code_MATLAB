## Introduction
This repository contains the pre-training data, source code, and package for the paper "Multi-to-uni Modal Knowledge Transfer Pre-training for Molecular Representation Learning". **M2UMol** is a **M**ulti-**to**-**U**ni modal knowledge transfer pre-training **Mol**ecular representation learning method. The characteristic of M2UMol is that it **can generate reliable multimodal representations solely based on molecular 2D topological graphs**, which is the key to efficient pre-training on incomplete multimodal data and superior performances on downstream tasks with only molecular 2D modality given.

## 2 Dataset

### 2.1 Pre-training dataset
We constructed the multimodal pre-training dataset based on [DrugBank](https://go.drugbank.com/). We first download the full data in XML format from [this link](https://go.drugbank.com/releases/latest#full), and filter out molecules which can not be converted to the 2D molecular graph by RDKit. Then we can download the structure data of molecules in [this link](https://go.drugbank.com/releases/latest#structures), and extract molecular 2D and 3D structure from these data in SDF format, which are the `2Dstructures.sdf` and the `3Dstructures.sdf`, respectively. After that, we extract the textual description of molecules from the full data, which is the `description-sup.csv`. Finally we extract the bio features, which includes targets and enzymes the molecules can interact/affect and the drug categories the molecules belong to, and then we can obtain lists of all the occurring targets, enzymes and drug categories, which are the `target_list.csv`, `enzyme_list.csv` and `drugcate_list.csv`. For the molecules, we encode them using one-hot encoding based on its association with target, enzyme and drug categories, which are the `targetfea.npy`, `targetfea.npy` and `drugcatefea.npy`. Our multimodal pre-training dataset can be downloaded in [this link](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Zhankun-Xiong/Dataset_for_M2UMol/tree/main/pretraining_M2UMol).

### 2.2 Fine-tuning datasets
#### Molecular property prediction
For the molecular property prediction, the origin datasets can obtained by the following commands:
```
wget http://snap.stanford.edu/gnn-pretrain/data/chem_dataset.zip
unzip chem_dataset.zip
```
Or you can download the data we used in [this link](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Zhankun-Xiong/Dataset_for_M2UMol/tree/main/finetuning_M2UMol/MPP_task)


#### Drug-drug interaction prediction
For the drug-drug interaction prediction, we utilize the dataset from our previous work [MRCGNN](https://github.com/Zhankun-Xiong/MRCGNN), which consists of 191,570 DDIs between 1,700 drugs with 86 types of DDI events and every DDI is associated with a DDI event. We applied cold start and scaffold split strategy to split the datasets, the details can be found in `split.py`. After that, we obtain the DDI datasets in three folds(note that for the scaffold split setting, the training dataset and the test dataset are the same across three fold). Or you can directly download the data and data splits we used in [this link](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Zhankun-Xiong/Dataset_for_M2UMol/tree/main/finetuning_M2UMol/DDI_task).

#### Drug-target interaction prediction
The origin datasets of drug-target prediction, BindingDB (consists of 49,199 DTIs between 14,643 molecules and 2,623 targets) and BioSNAP (consists of 27,464 DTIs between 4,510 molecules and 2,181 targets), can be obtained from [BindingDB](https://www.bindingdb.org/bind/index.jsp) and [BioSNAP](https://github.com/kexinhuang12345/MolTrans). Since we used the DrugBAN framework for DTI prediction, you can also download them in [DrugBAN datasets](https://github.com/peizhenbai/DrugBAN/tree/main/datasets) or directly download it in [this link](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Zhankun-Xiong/Dataset_for_M2UMol/tree/main/finetuning_M2UMol/DTI_task).


## 3 Pretraining M2UMol
You can first check the 'settings' in 'run_pretrain.py', and modify them according to your needs. You can also set parameters directly in the training command, for example:

```
python run_pretrain.py --num_layers 3 --lr 0.001 --batch 32 --epochs 150 --tem 1.0 --mcls_loss_ratio 0.5 --output_name M2UMol
```

For the Text encoder, we utlized a pre-trained large language model (LLM) PubMedBERT proposed by Microsoft. We download pre-trained PubMedBERT at [this Hugging Face link](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/BiomedNLP-BiomedBERT-base-uncased-abstract-fulltext/tree/main), and save them in a folder named `pretrained-PubMedBERT`, you can also derectly download in [this link](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Zhankun-Xiong/Dataset_for_M2UMol/tree/main/pretraining_M2UMol/pretrained-PubMedBERT). For the 3D encoder, we utlized ComENet, a recently proposed method as the encoder, and implement it by using the [dive-into-graphs](https://github.com/divelab/DIG)

Note that the Text encoder and the 3D encoder are all further pre-trained in our pre-training phase, that is, the parameters of these models are not frozen. In addition, you can easily replace different large language models and 3D conformation encoders by modifying the parameters in `layer.py`.

The paramters of our pre-trained M2UMol `pre-trained_M2UMol.pt` can be downloaded in our [huggingface project](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Zhankun-Xiong/Dataset_for_M2UMol/blob/main/pre-trained_M2UMol.pt). After downloading it, you can put it in the same directory as the run script to use our package or reproduce our results.

## 4 Finetuning on three downstream tasks
We comprehensively verified the model performance of M2UMol through three downstream tasks: molecular property prediction, drug-drug interaction prediction and drug-target interaction prediction.

### 4.1 Downstream task 1 :Molecular property prediction

For the molecular property prediction, you can use the following commands for training and testing for three times with three different seeds:
```
python run.py
```
You can also set different parameters in `run.py` or run for one time by the following commands:
```
python train.py --dataset clintox --runseed 0 --batch_size 64 --mweight_decay 0.0005  --mdropout 0.2  --mattdropout 0.1 --mlr 0.0005  --jingtiaolr 0.0002 
```
where `--split random` and `--split scaffold` can choose the split settings, `--dataset clintox` can choose the dataset settings.

### 4.2 Downstream task 2 :Drug-drug interaction prediction
For the drug-drug interaction prediction, you can use the following commands for training and testing for three times with three different seeds (for the cold start split setting, it means three different split):
```
python run.py
```
You can also set different parameters in `run.py` or run for one time by the following commands:
```
python main.py --seed 0 --lr 0.0005 --batch 256 --weight_decay 0.0002 --dropout 0.7 --split scaffold
```
where `--split cold` and `--split scaffold` can choose the split settings, we provide both cold start split setting and scaffold split setting, which we used in our paper.

### 4.3 Downstream task 3 :Drug-target interaction prediction
For the drug-target interaction prediction, we utlized the framework of [DrugBAN](https://github.com/peizhenbai/DrugBAN) to evaluate the performances of M2UMol on the challenging cross-domain drug-target prediction tasks(named scaffold split setting in ou paper). Based on DrugBAN, we replace the molecular preprocessing procedure and the molecular encoder with our preprocessing procedure and M2UMol. You can use the following commands for training and testing for five times with five different seeds:
```
python run.py
```
You can also set different parameters in `run.py` or run for one time by the following commands:
```
python main.py --cfg "configs/DrugBAN_DA.yaml" --data bindingdb --split "cluster" --seed 0
```
where `--cfg` is the config file of DrugBAN, for the scaffold split setting, we recommend using `DrugBAN_DA.yaml`. `--data` can choose the DTI datasets, 'bindingdb' and 'biosnap' are available. `--split` can choose the split settings, 'random' and 'cluster' are available('cluster' denotes the scaffold split setting in our paper).


## 5 The package based on M2UMol

### 5.1 How to use M2UMol for molecular representation learning in your own project
For how to use M2UMol as a general molecular encoder, we present an example in [here](https://anonymous.4open.science/r/M2UMol-5F2B/M2UMol_package/molecular_representation_learning) and you can use it by using the command `python toysample_encoder.py`. It can directly take SMILES as inputs and can learn fix representations with multimodal knowledge, which can be used as the feature or fingerprint of the molecule:
```python
import torch
from data_process import create_all_graph_data,construct_graph
from M2UMol import M2UMolencoder, model_load

# Input the SMILES
smiles_list=['ClC1=CC2=C(NC(=O)CN=C2C2=CC=CC=C2Cl)C=C1']
graph=construct_graph(create_all_graph_data(smiles_list),0).cuda()

#Define M2UMol encoder and load the pre-trained M2UMol model
model=M2UMolencoder().cuda()
model.eval()
model=model_load(model,'pre-trained_M2UMol.pt')

representation2d,generated_3d,generated_text,generated_bio=model(graph)
print('final representation')
print(representation2d.cpu().detach().numpy())
```
The output is:
```python
final representation
[[-1.20773971e+00  9.97009516e-01  5.55726171e-01  2.88000011e+00 ... -6.52980864e-01 -8.60271811e-01  1.30764246e-01  2.13101649e+00]]
```

If you want fine-tuning M2UMol in your own downstream tasks, we also present an example in [here] and you can use it by using the command 'python toysample_training.py'. Our pre-trained M2UMol can be easily used as a molecular encoder for a various molecular-related tasks, and because it is only a part of our pre-trained model, it is very efficient and lightweight for fine-tuning
```python
import torch
from data_process import create_all_graph_data,construct_graph,construct_graph_batch
from M2UMol import create_model, model_load
import numpy as np
from sklearn.metrics import roc_auc_score

#Prepare the input data and label. We recommend using the dataloader of pytorch or pytorch-geometric, here is just a simple example
smiles_list=['O1CC[C@@H](NC(=O)[C@@H](Cc2cc3cc(ccc3nc2N)-c2ccccc2C)C)CC1(C)C',
             'Fc1cc(cc(F)c1)C[C@H](NC(=O)[C@@H](N1CC[C@](NC(=O)C)(CC(C)C)C1=O)CCc1ccccc1)[C@H](O)[C@@H]1[NH2+]C[C@H](OCCC)C1',
             'S1(=O)(=O)N(c2cc(cc3c2n(cc3CC)CC1)C(=O)N[C@H]([C@H](O)C[NH2+]Cc1cc(OC)ccc1)Cc1ccccc1)C',
             'S1(=O)(=O)C[C@@H](Cc2cc(O[C@H](COCC)C(F)(F)F)c(N)c(F)c2)[C@H](O)[C@@H]([NH2+]Cc2cc(ccc2)C(C)(C)C)C1',
             'S1(=O)(=O)N(c2cc(cc3c2n(cc3CC)CC1)C(=O)N[C@H]([C@H](O)C[NH2+]Cc1cc(ccc1)C(F)(F)F)Cc1ccccc1)C',
             'S(=O)(=O)(C(CCC)CCC)C[C@@H](NC(OCc1ccccc1)=O)C(=O)N[C@H]([C@H](O)C[NH2+]Cc1cc(OC)ccc1)Cc1ccccc1',
             'Fc1cc(cc(F)c1)C[C@H](NC(=O)c1cc(cc(c1)C)C(=O)N(CCC)CCC)[C@H](O)[C@@H]1[NH2+]CC[N@@H+](C1)Cc1ccccc1',
             'S(=O)(=O)(N[C@@H]1C[C@H](C[C@@H](C1)C(=O)N[C@H]([C@@H](O)CC(=O)N[C@@H](CC(C)C)C(=O)N[C@H](C(=O)N([C@H](CC1CCCCC1)C(=O)N1CCC[C@H]1C(OC)=O)C)C)CC1CCCCC1)C(=O)N[C@H](C)C1CCCCC1)C',
             'S1(=O)(=O)C[C@@H](Cc2cc(F)c3NCC4(CCC(F)(F)CC4)c3c2)[C@H](O)[C@@H]([NH2+]Cc2cc(ccc2)C(C)(C)C)C1',
             'O=C(N1CC[C@H](C[C@H]1c1ccccc1)c1ccccc1)[C@@H]1C[NH2+]C[C@]12CCCc1c2cccc1']
all_label=[1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0]

#construct the graph data, the M2UMol model and the optimizer
graph=construct_graph_batch(create_all_graph_data(smiles_list)).cuda()
model,optimizer=create_model()
model.cuda()
model.eval()
model=model_load(model,'pre-trained_M2UMol.pt')
loss_fct = torch.nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss()

for epoch in range(10):
    print('-------- Epoch ' + str(epoch + 1) + ' --------')

    model.train()
    label=all_label
    label = torch.from_numpy(np.array(label)).cuda()
    output = model(graph).squeeze()
    loss = loss_fct(output, label.float())
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()

    label_ids = label.to('cpu').numpy()
    acc = roc_auc_score(label_ids.flatten().tolist(), output.flatten().tolist())
    print(acc)
```

### 5.2 Molecular analysis tool
We combined M2UMol's ability to discover important functional groups and multimodal retrieval to develop a molecular analysis tool [molecular analysis tool](https://anonymous.4open.science/r/M2UMol-5F2B/M2UMol_package/molecular_analysis) and integrate it into package. To run it, you can use the following command: 
```
python moleculartool.py --genericname no
```
Note that `--genericname yes` can show the generic name of molecules. Then you will be asked to enter the options. :
```
Please enter the SMILES of the molecule:COC(=O)N1CCC[C@H](NS(C)(=O)=O)[C@@H]1CO[C@H]1CC[C@H](CC1)C1=CC=CC=C1
Please enter the threshold of the attention coefficient:(-1,1), separated by Spaces:-1 0 0.5
```
After that you can obtain a  html files as follow:
<p align="center">
  <img src="pics/molecular_analysis.png" width="100%"/> 
</p>

The specific explanations for each section are as follows:
<p align="center">
  <img src="pics/molecular_analysis_des.png" width="100%"/> 
</p>

#### Matters needing attention about the tool:
1. The Canonical SMILES is recommended as the input.
2. Some molecules may have long generic names, you can often choose 'no' to make the result more concise.
3. The html file will be generated in 'HTMLpainter' fold, which named in the format "$YOUR SMILES$-molecular_information.html". You can open it up and view the molecular analysis we provided. In addition, a folder named "$YOUR SMILES$" containing the attention visualizations and the molecular structure images will be generated, please keep this folder in the same directory as the html file).
4. Due to size limitations, the data on which the tool is based can be downloaded in [this link](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Zhankun-Xiong/Dataset_for_M2UMol/tree/main/molecular_analysis).

Here in, the example molecule we chose did not appear in our pre-training phase. For this molecule, only its SMILES is available in DrugBank, which can simulate an extreme case of molecular analysis where the available information about the molecule is sometimes very poor or only SMILES is available. The tool can be used as an AI-assisted drug design tool to visualize the importance of each part of a molecule, retrieve data from the library for four modes, and search drugs that may be similar to it, while only inputting molecular SMILES. This information may be able to provide reference for researchers and guide the direction of experiments to a certain extent, which will help the process of drug discovery and drug development.
