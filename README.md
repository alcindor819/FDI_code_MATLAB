## Introduction
This repository contains the pre-training data, source code, and package for the paper "Fragment Dispersity Index: A cfDNA fragmentation pattern precise describing chromatin accessibility and its application in early cancer detection".
 **FDI** is a  cfDNA fragmentation pattern which precisely characterizes chromatin accessibility. Utilizing FDI, we identified key regulatory elements involved in cancer development.
 We provide evidence that FDI has the potential to facilitate early cancer detection, tissue-of-origin prediction, cancer subtyping, and prognosis. 
This code provides modules for **FDI calculation, dispersed regions identification and evaluation**, as well as modules for **K-fold cross-validation, independent validation and tissue-of-origin inference for cancer classification**.
